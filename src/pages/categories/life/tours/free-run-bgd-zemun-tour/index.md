Beautiful Danube river bank. Walk through the old part of todays Belgrade, but bear in mind that Zemun has completely different history. Walk through the modern wide boulevards, old narrow streets and enjoy the view from the Gardos hill where Millennium tower is. Find out why the settlement was made here in neolithic.

Every Saturday @ 3pm during the whole year. Bus tickets required.\
Please be at the meeting point 5 minutes earlier. Buy the ticket beforehand.
