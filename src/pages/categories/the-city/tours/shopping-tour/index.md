Get to know architecture of Social Communist times built to represent power of newly created Yugoslavia. Take a look over the Belgrade from observation deck of Avala Telecommunication Tower placed on Belgrade’s tallest mountain. Destroyed in NATO bombarding in 1999, it resurrected from the ruins in 2010. Cross over the Ada bridge above Sava river. The bridge whose construction is shown on Discovery channel and is the biggest single pillion bridge in Europe. Pass through the gates of Belgrade – Western gate, Geneks twin towers connected with bridge on the 26th floor and Eastern gate, Rudo buildings both built in brutalism style. You’ll see the “Sava” Center, the project built for the needs of the Conference on European Security and Cooperation held in Belgrade in 1977, that was first and biggest conference center in former Yugoslavia. Here you can examine structural design of polyhedral buildings of this huge complex. You’ll stand in front of the Palace of Serbia, ex Federal Executive Council, spectacular building of late modernism that shows how design can represent the ruling ideology. Enormous but elegant structure was the first project of New Belgrade after the WWII.

This is the tour where architecture lovers can enjoy the architecture of brutalism and structuralism, that was mostly shaped by ideology of former Yugoslavia.
