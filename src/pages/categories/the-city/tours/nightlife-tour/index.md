...diving into Belgrade's nightlife...
(about 3 hours)
Belgrade is a city that never sleeps and well-known for groovy & outgoing nightlife.

We will take you to the journey from traditional tavern “kafana” with live Serbian music to flashy and wild floating river club “splav” or into the urban underground scene.
