      RUN BGD is a team of young and ambitious people gathered around the idea
      of ​​presenting Belgrade as a tourist destination in a slightly different
      light. Unlike agencies and other organizations, we want to bring Belgrade
      closer to the young people of Europe and show them the urban spirit of the
      city through the night life with quality day and night entertainment in
      our organization, selected lesser known cultural and artistic events,
      restaurants, local cuisine, "street food ”, cafes, clubs, shops, etc.
      Experience Belgrade with the experience of Belgraders - #RUNBGD

      From year to year, more and more tourists are discovering Belgrade, which is slowly returning to the map of the most interesting cities in Europe. Despite that, there are few online platforms that can offer foreigners in English the entire offer in one place, and that is exactly our main goal.  The potential and talent we possess in the worlds of music, art, design and creativity are the main trump cards that we can present to the world together. That is why we invite various local companies, artists and brands to start Belgrade even stronger!

    sectionText: >-
      RUNBGD tourist packages are especially intended for people who want to get
      to know the destination in a different way, more intimately, in pairs or
      with friends, where with a local guide and RUNBGD Belgraders will have the
      opportunity to experience what is not possible during classically
      organized tours.

      Each basic package with us includes transportation, accommodation and guides, with the possibility of additional content in the form of concerts, sporting events, day trips and tours, as well as other events in Belgrade, which we organize for our clients. The offer will include recommendations for selected restaurants and bars with which we have achieved successful cooperation, and which stand out with quality food, choice of drinks and creative services.

      Through our offer, we will also recommend the most interesting restaurants and bars with which we have successfully cooperated. Our goal is for guests to feel the local atmosphere, and visit those places that are not marked on all signs in the city, but are carefully selected by locals.

    sectionHeading: RUN BGD - MAP
    sectionText: >-
      In addition to written reviews and a list of all locations in the city,
      the easiest way for tourists to find everything they need is a
      personalized MAP.

      We are currently working on building a new site where the primary position will be an interactive map with selected and verified information - where the accommodation is, where I can eat, drink, go to the museum, swim, train, play until the morning.

    sectionHeading: RUN BGD - CONCEPT STORE
    sectionText: >-
      Our plan for the next year is to launch a conceptual space in Belgrade, as
      such unique in the city, where we would gather both ours and people from
      abroad interested in culture, art, sports, fashion. The space would
      include an art gallery, a bar, a shop, an agency with space for work
      (coworking), sales and exhibition places for young talents, designers and
      artists.

      Multifunctionality would be reflected in the fact that individual parts can be easily transformed into a more spacious space suitable for cultural events, gatherings, meetings, workshops or seminars.

      We are on the way for RUNBGD to become an unavoidable place for the local and international urban community. We want to encourage the promotion of innovative ideas that set Belgrade apart from others as a destination. Our focus will be on domestic creatively designed brands, products, locations, and on everything that fits into the concept of "From Belgrade for Belgrade”.
