      Community Management is first called Community Understanding. Communities
      are social structures. With own values, codes, rules and rituals. They
      always occur when several people commit to a common cause. And that can be
      a lot: brand community or corporate community. Yes, that's it. These
      communities have mutual dynamics, which we penetrate and understand thanks
      to sociological foundation.


      The value of community management is therefore measured on the one hand by knowledge and understanding of the communities themselves and on the other hand by setting new impulses in them. To actively and carefully contribute to the growth of communities. Be it for communities that have dedicated themselves to the brand or the company. So for customers or employees.

    body: We love big opera. And down to the smallest detail. That's why at RUN BGD
      we do not just push chairs when premieres are coming up. We create spaces.
      Places for stories. Places where memories are made. Because these spaces
      are playgrounds for interaction. Indoor, outdoor, with and without door.

    body: Online branding is still a big question mark for a large number of small
      businesses, and even for some large business companies. A lot of companies
      are still under the assumption that branding is something difficult to
      measure, and sometimes it is – unless it’s approached strategically.

    body: "What do Apple, the Hells Angels and the Buddha have in common? They are
      all brands that stand for something. You can believe in them or leave
      them. They love or hate. Although that is certainly difficult with Buddha.
      In any case, they have what all brands should own: identity. The basis for
      authenticity and thus for real, true marketing."

    heading: Brand follows identity
    type: section
    backgroundColor: ffffff
    imageOnRight: false
    body: We think so in the development of brand strategies. Brand Identity and
      Positioning have no artificiality or 0815 brand values. Everything follows
      the identity of the company. The brand as an audible, visible and tangible
      reflection of mission and vision. And once that's done, a brand can be
      anything - interactive platform, storyteller and community, for customers
      and employees.
