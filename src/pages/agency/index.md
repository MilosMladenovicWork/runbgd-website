      The idea is to use the co-working space and creative brands (tenants) to
      create a creative hub/agency with local and international freelancers
      besides the core of the agency which is located local.


      With the understanding of the local economical markets and experience as well deep and bright international network we can offer companies willing to invest in Belgrade and Serbia the knowledge and analysis to either the Serbian market.

    body: "Community Management is first called Community Understanding. Communities
      are social structures. With own values, codes, rules and rituals. They
      always occur when several people commit to a common cause. And that can be
      a lot: brand community or corporate community. Yes, that's it. These
      communities have mutual dynamics, which we penetrate and understand thanks
      to sociological foundation."

    body: The value of community management is therefore measured on the one hand by
      knowledge and understanding of the communities themselves and on the other
      hand by setting new impulses in them. To actively and carefully contribute
      to the growth of communities. Be it for communities that have dedicated
      themselves to the brand or the company. So for customers or employees.

      all brands that stand for something. You can believe in them or leave
      them. They love or hate. Although that is certainly difficult with Buddha.
      In any case, they have what all brands should own: identity. The basis for
      authenticity and thus for real, true marketing."

    backgroundColor: ffffff
    imageOnRight: false
    body: We think so in the development of brand strategies. Brand Identity and
      Positioning have no artificiality or 0815 brand values. Everything follows
      the identity of the company. The brand as an audible, visible and tangible
      reflection of mission and vision. And once that's done, a brand can be
      anything - interactive platform, storyteller and community, for customers
      and employees.

      We register tendencies. Go on it. We get involved. And understand by that.
      This is how knowledge is created. And ideas with a head start. That's what
      our customers feel. Because even they like surprises. But also control.
