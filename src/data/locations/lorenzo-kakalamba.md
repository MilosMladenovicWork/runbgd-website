  **Whereyoueatwell Lorenzo and KAKALAMBA** is the original space with the unique conception based on the conflict between Florence and Pirot. The whole idea came from one simple and sincere promise of a caring husband to his beloved wife at the beginning of the marriage: "Honey, I can promise you one thing: You will never be hungry!" Impressive amateur venture of this gourmand enthusiast got its shocking outcome that surely will not leave you indifferent. If you don't trip up at the entrance to one of the clumsily hidden cables, or God forbid, fall through the hole in the floor directly to the kitchen into the pot with delicious delicacies, you will find your way to one of the unusual chairs and order some of divine specialties from the Florentine or Pirot cuisine. Once you satisfy your gourmet appetite you will notice around a multitude of interesting details, from goat witch is peacefully grazing grass on the ceiling, through the comic reproductions of the famous Florentine sculptures to the fantastic paintings of the famous Botero.
