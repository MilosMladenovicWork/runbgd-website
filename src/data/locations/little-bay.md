  Little Bay restaurant is a part of the restaurant chain of the same name in London and Brighton. After four successful Little Bay restaurants in London, their owner, Dragiša Piter Ilić decided to give his home country some of that bountiful experience made in the decades-long work in the harsh business climate of the World’s catering capital.\

  \

  He brought positive experience from the demanding London market to Belgrade, along with a step forward to genuineness of recipes and selection.\

  \

  With the need for quick profit far behind him, led with genuineness imperative, he gave his designer a task, and the result was a unique blend of music, art and cuisine. And just like that, Belgrade got a present of the only restaurant in the world dedicated to classical music, a culture shrine and a patron to young musicians.\

  \

  This restaurant is something much more than any categorization could define. That’s maybe because it’s a venue of such simple character, that it mesmerizes and puts the spectator in awe at the first glance of it.
